  ## Description  ✏️
  
  Match users with the pet of their dreams. 

  This is the server side of a app using headless architecture. The client is located at https://github.com/femke77/pet-adoption-client

  This app uses session authentication for no good reason other than for me to practice since I've been doing a ton of JWT lately. 
  
  A husky pre-commit hook is linting my staged files to ensure good code uniformity with prettier rules.

  Sequelize is my ORM for a PostgreSql database. Express is my server. Express router handles the routing.
